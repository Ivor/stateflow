= Stateflow

== TODO

* More Persistence layers
* Tests

This is the basics of the gem. THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY UNTIL TESTS ARE DONE. Please check out the examples directory for usage until this README gets fleshed out. Feel free to fork and modify as you please.

== INSTALL

  gem install stateflow

== Usage

As you can see below, Stateflow's API is very similar to AASM, but allows for a more dynamic state transition flow. Stateflow supports persistence/storage with MongoMapper, and ActiveRecord. Request any others or push them to me.

Stateflow defaults to ActiveRecord but you can set the persistence layer with:

  Stateflow.persistence = :mongo_mapper
OR
  Stateflow.persistence = :active_record
  
Stateflow allows dynamic :to transitions with :decide. The result :decide returns needs to be one of the states listed in the :to array, otherwise it wont allow the transition. Please view the advanced example below for usage.

You can set the default column with the state_column function in the stateflow block. The default state column is "state".

  state_column :state

== Basic Example

Please note these examples need a persistence layer to operate. I might allow non persistent stateflows in the future.

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'stateflow'

  class Robot
    include Stateflow
  
    stateflow do
      initial :green
    
      state :green, :yellow, :red
    
      event :change_color do
        transitions :from => :green, :to => :yellow
        transitions :from => :yellow, :to => :red
        transitions :from => :red, :to => :green
      end
    end
  end
  
== Advanced Example

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'stateflow'

  class Test
    include Stateflow
  
    stateflow do
    
      initial :love
    
      state :love do
        enter lambda { |t| p "Entering love" }
        exit :exit_love
      end
    
      state :hate do
        enter lambda { |t| p "Entering hate" }
        exit lambda { |t| p "Exiting hate" }
      end
    
      state :mixed do
        enter lambda { |t| p "Entering mixed" }
        exit lambda { |t| p "Exiting mixed" }
      end
    
      event :b do
        transitions :from => :love, :to => :hate, :if => :no_ice_cream
        transitions :from => :hate, :to => :love
      end
    
      event :a do
        transitions :from => :love, :to => [:hate, :mixed], :decide => :likes_ice_cream?
        transitions :from => [:hate, :mixed], :to => :love
      end
    end
  
    def likes_ice_cream?
      rand(10) > 5 ? :mixeds : :hate
    end
  
    def exit_love
      p "Exiting love"
    end
  
    def no_ice_cream
      rand(4) > 2 ? true : false
    end
  end

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
